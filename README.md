## Usage instructions

If you just want to create a marker sheet, this app is available at http://inf-dice.ghostlords.com/markers/

Should that site go down, a new copy may be installed by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository to a local directory.
2. Install the required tools: pdfimages, wget, ImageMagick
3. Install the required Perl modules: CGI, PDF::Create, Data::Dumper, Image::Size
4. Run `make` to extract, resize, and convert all images.
5. run `make install` to copy `index.pl`, `jpg/`, and `thumb/` to your web server's directory.
6. Ensure that you have execute permissions for Perl scripts.  Apache's mod_perl is not required or used.
